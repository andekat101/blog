For those who work with data processing, compliance, security, legal, etc., the creation of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) had major impact in how user data of European citizens is handled. From the Microsoft Security side, it also meant a lot of work around product development, messaging, and training for data processing and sharing ahead of the May 2018 implementation.

I came up with GDPaRty, the GDPR Drinking game, for two reasons: 1. To put a fun spin on GDPR for my colleagues (who were doing a lot of work around it already), and 2. To introduce GDPR to friends who weren’t familiar with the new rules and regulations.

The game is loosely based on “King’s Cup” (a drinking game), with a deck of cards, face-down, encircling a bottle or can of beverage of choice and with a group of 4+ people taking turns pulling cards from the pile. It’s designed to be fun and informative, and was particularly enjoyed by friends in the legal or data compliance fields. In 2019 I even designed decks of “Official GDPaRty™” cards, printing 100 custom decks with Shuffled Ink ([www.shuffledink.com](http://www.shuffledink.com/)). It was good insight in how to trademark brand names with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and even setting up an Etsy store to sell and distribute a few of the decks.

As we approach three years since GDPR went live, and as more data protection regulations like CCPA go into law, I wanted to share out the GDPaRty rules for anyone who may want to play it or modify it themselves -   

Without further ado… Here are the rules for GDPaRty™: The GDPR Drinking Game!
