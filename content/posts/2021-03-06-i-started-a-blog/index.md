excerpt: I started a blog and this is why
---

It's March 6, 2021. We're one week away from the first anniversary of the Covid lockdown in New York. I have written two children's books, read five books on cyber-security, created a detailed budget for my husband and myself to keep us on track for purchasing a home later this year, and have been averaging 15 thousand steps a day... Or at least I would have done all that stuff if I didn't have the crushing weight of a global pandemic and the expectation at work to be even more productive than pre-pandemic levels; "you don't have to commute anymore" they say!

Ok so maybe instead of all of that stuff, I've actually watched ALL of the Marvel movies, Tiger King, Love is Blind, the Witcher, Altered Carbon, all of Friends again, all of the Office again, all of Veep again, all of Silicon Valley again, all of Brooklyn 99 again, The Queens Gambit, Haunting of Hill House, Bridgerton, The Umbrella Academy, The Boys, Upload, Fleabag, and so. many. more.

Now that I've finished all of the available internet video content, I'm going to take some time to write some great tips, tricks, and tutorials for you all to make you better and more productive with computer tools you may or may not have already heard of. So buckle up and prepare for some awesomeness.
